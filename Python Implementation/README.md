# Description of files in this directory.

The files here is a starter file for UVic SENG 265, Summer 2021
Assignment #4 along with two test-driver scripts.

* ```concord4.py```: This is contain all of your work, within
the class named `Concordance`.

* ```tester4.py```: Processes command-line arguments and then
uses an instance of your `Concordance` class to produce a
keyword-in-context concordance. You may modify this file as needed for
your own testing.

* ```official-tester.py```: This is the script the teaching-team will
use to evaluate your code. There is no point in you modifying this
code as we will be using our version of it. Please note that this
tester disabled output to `stdout` when instantiating a `Concordance`
object and invoking methods on that object.

* Various tests files (input, output)
